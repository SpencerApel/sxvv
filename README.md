# Simple X Video Viewer

This program is meant to give a thumbnail view of each video given from standard input and when a video is selected, it will play in your favorite video player.

This program is inspired from [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) and their thumbnail view, to easily view all photos and select one to view. 

Not many linux video players support thumbnails, and the only way I have noticed to view thumbnails from videos is with a file manager. I do not use a file manager, just simply the terminal. This program is not a video player, rather a video selector with thumbnail support to give the user an idea what the video will be about. 

I wanted to create this program because many of my backed up videos from my phone have names like: "screenrecording-01-01-2020.mp4" similar to the naming conventions on screenshots. And I would have no idea what the video would be about. [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) fixed the issue for my photos and screenshots, but I needed something for my videos.
