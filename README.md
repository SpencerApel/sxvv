# Simple X Video Viewer

This program is meant to give a thumbnail view of each video given from standard input and when a video is selected, it will play in your favorite video player.

This program is inspired from [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) (actually, I took the source code from version 0.7 and stripped down a lot of the features to start this project) and their thumbnail view, to easily view all photos and select one to view. 

Not many linux video players support thumbnails, and the only way I have noticed to view thumbnails from videos is with a file manager. I do not use a file manager, just simply the terminal. This program is not a video player, rather a video selector with thumbnail support to give the user an idea what the video will be about. 

I wanted to create this program because many of my backed up videos from my phone have names like: "screenrecording-01-01-2020.mp4" similar to the naming conventions on screenshots. And I would have no idea what the video would be about. [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) fixed the issue for my photos and screenshots, but I needed something for my videos.
